# NPMap Library

NPMap is a JavaScript library developed, maintained, and used by the U.S. National Park Service. It creates an abstraction layer around various web mapping APIs ("Base APIs" in NPMap-speak) that exposes commonly-used functionality through a simple and targeted API. NPMap also provides a number of custom components and a look-and-feel that is specific to the National Park Service.
