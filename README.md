# The NPMap Library

NPMap is a JavaScript astraction library developed, maintained, and used by the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov). It creates a "wrapper" around various web mapping APIs (namely Bing, Google, Leaflet, and Modest Maps) and exposes commonly-used functionality through a simple and targeted API. NPMap also provides a number of custom components and a look-and-feel that fits in with the graphic identity of the National Park Service.

For more information, including full [API documentation](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/library/api), a [gallery of maps](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/gallery) that have been built with NPMap, and a bunch of more [targeted examples](http://www.nps.gov/npmap/support/library/examples) for developers, take a look at the [NPMap website](http:/www.nps.gov/npmap).
