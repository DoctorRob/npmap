# NPMap Library

NPMap is a JavaScript (astraction) library developed, maintained, and used by the [U.S. National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov). It creates a "wrapper" around various web mapping APIs. This abstraction layer exposes commonly-used functionality through a simple and targeted API. In addition, NPMap provides a number of custom components and a look-and-feel that fits in with the graphic identity of the National Park Service.
